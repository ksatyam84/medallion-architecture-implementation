    "### 1. Core CVE Table (1:1 with Bronze)\n",
    "- Flattens nested CVE metadata structure\n",
    "- Extracts CVSS scores with intelligent fallback (v3.1 → v3.0 → v2.0)\n",
    "- Standardizes timestamp formats using `to_timestamp`\n",
    "- One record per CVE for efficient querying\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Affected Products Table (1:N Explosion)\n",
    "- **Explode Operation**: Flattens nested vendor/product arrays\n",
    "- Creates separate row for each product affected by a CVE\n",
    "- Enables vendor-level and product-level risk analysis\n",
    "- Typical explosion ratio: 3-5x Bronze record count\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Quality & Defensive Programming\n",
    "- Handles null values gracefully with `explode_outer`\n",
    "- Uses backtick notation for columns with special characters\n",
    "- Implements `get_json_object` for nested field extraction\n",
    "- Validates data integrity with counts and samples\n",

    "##  Key Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- **JSON Parsing**: Deep nested structure navigation in Spark\n",
    "- **Normalization**: Converting nested arrays to relational tables\n",
